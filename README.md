### Dependencies ###
The EFM Calculator is freely available as a web tool at the [Barrick Lab website](http://www.barricklab.org/efm) and is compatible with Chrome, Firefox, and Safari. If you would like to set a local implementation of the EFM Calculator you will need to install the following:

* Django v3.2.5  (Only required for browser-based output)
* Python v3.8
* MUMmer v3.23

If you are interested in obtaining raw output from the EFM Calculator and bypassing the browser-based results view, see the 'efm_helper.py' file.
